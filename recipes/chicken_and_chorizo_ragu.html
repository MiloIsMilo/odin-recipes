    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>120g cooking chorizo, chopped</li>
      <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, grated</li>
      <li>1 tsp hot smoked paprika</li>
      <li>80g sundried tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>600g skinless and boneless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
      <li>100ml chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>jacket potatoes, chopped parsley and soured cream, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to cook it!</h2>
    <h3><strong>STEP 1</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Fry the chorizo over a medium heat in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole dish 
      for 5 mins or until it releases its oil and starts to char at the edges. Add the onion 
      and fry for 5 mins more or until soft. Tip in the garlic and cook for 2 mins before 
      stirring in the paprika and sundried tomatoes. Add the chicken thighs and fry for 2 mins 
      each side until they are well coated in the spices and beginning to brown.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3><strong>STEP 2</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Pour in the chopped tomatoes and stock, and turn the heat down. Cover and cook for 40 mins 
      until the chicken is falling apart and the sauce is thick. Stir the lemon juice through. Serve 
      by piling spoonfuls of the ragu into hot jacket potatoes with parsley sprinkled over and a dollop 
      of soured cream, if you like.
